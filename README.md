# Becca: A Fashion Chatbot

## Overview

Everyone wants to look their best in today's world. Appearance is the first of many things someone notices about another person, but not everyone has the time or knowledge to keep up with fashion trends. This is where a personal stylist comes in. A personal stylist can help an individual find their own unique style that fits their personality and lifestyle. A personal stylist can also provide advice on how to mix and match outfits and incorporate the latest fashion trends into their wardrobe. But personal stylists are expensive and may not be a feasible option for everyone. This is where artificial intelligence (A.I.) comes in. Personal stylist bots created with artificial intelligence can provide personalised styling recommendations based on your preferences, body shape, and budget. It can save you time and money while still giving you a professional styling experience. Our fashion chat bot, Becca, is created exactly for this purpose. Based on the latest fashion trends, the items you already own, and your personal style, Becca will assist you in finding additional pieces for your outfit. If youâ€™re also interested in finding a new style, you can discover new styles with Becca's guidance. Becca will aid you in identifying and creating outfits for a specific event or dress code. Becca is a at-home companion who assists you in feeling confident and stylish in any situation. Her expertise in fashion and personal styling will make getting dressed an enjoyable and stress-free experience.
