Q: How is the 'colour_names_ontology.json' organised?
A: There are 3 primary and 3 secondary colours, they are listed as the following:
- Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, and Purple

Hue values range from 0 deg to 360 degrees. I separated the 'colour_names.csv' within the following ranges:
- Red -> 330 ~ 15 deg    
- Orange -> 15 ~ 45 deg
- Yellow -> 45 ~ 75 deg
- Green -> 75 ~ 165 deg
- Blue -> 165 ~ 255 deg
- Purple -> 255 ~ 330 deg

Q: Which colour format should you use? HEX, RGB, or HSL?
- HEX -> most popular way to set CSS colour properties; supported in almost all browser
- RGB -> allows you to add opacity to the colour
- HSL -> (HSLA = an extension with alpha) hue, saturation, lightness=brightness

A: Not much of a difference. Use HEX value to pass to ChatGPT

# how to print dataframes from the pandas import
import pandas as pd

data = {
  "calories": [420, 380, 390],
  "duration": [50, 40, 45]
}

#load data into a DataFrame object:
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

print(df)
print('=========================')

# search for 420 in the column 'calories' -- works
print(df.loc[df['calories'] == 420])
print('=========================')

# search for 420 in the column 'calories' -- works
print(df.loc[df['calories'].isin([420, 390])])
