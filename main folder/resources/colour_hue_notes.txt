Primary and Secondary Colours:
- Red -> 330 ~ 15       | or: 285 ~ 15
- Orange -> 15 ~ 45
- Yellow -> 45 ~ 75
- Green -> 75 ~ 165
- Blue -> 165 ~ 255

Which colour format should you use? HEX, RGB, or HSL?
- HEX -> most popular way to set CSS colour properties; supported in almost all browser
- RGB -> allows you to add opacity to the colour
- HSL -> (HSLA = an extension with alpha)

Not much of a difference. Use HEX value to pass to ChatGPT
